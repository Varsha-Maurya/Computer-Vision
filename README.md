## EyeDetection 
	
In this project, we had to detect the iris of the humans and locate it in the image. The image could be perturbed as well please check the following to see the implementation.[Eye Detection algorithm](https://github.com/Varsha-Maurya/Computer-Vision/blob/master/EyeDetection/Assignment1_eyeDetection.pdf)

## Hybrid Images
	
The goal of this assignment is to create [hybrid images](http://cvcl.mit.edu/hybrid_gallery/gallery.html) using a modification of the approach described in [SIGGRAPH 2006 paper](http://cvcl.mit.edu/publications/OlivaTorralb_Hybrid_Siggraph06.pdf) by Oliva, Torralba, and Schyns. Hybrid images are static images that change in interpretation as a function of the viewing distance. The basic idea is that high frequency tends to dominate perception when it is available, but, at a distance, only the low frequency (smooth) part of the signal can be seen. By blending the high-frequency portion of one image with the low-frequency portion of another, you get a hybrid image that leads to different interpretations at different distances.

Please check the following for implementation details
